# Pattern-Recognition
In this repository you can find the sequential and parallel version of a "Pattern Recognition" algorithm, defined in C++, which allows you to analyze datasets of numeric values to compare them with a specific search query.
This kind of algorithm is useful for lots of branches of computer science, like Machine Learning, Bioinformatics and so on.
Every implementation detail is inside "Report.pdf" file.

# Important Note
If you want to analyse some Dataset which contains even non-numeric values, you can still use those algorithms anywhay. Please follow the instruction inside the Report!
